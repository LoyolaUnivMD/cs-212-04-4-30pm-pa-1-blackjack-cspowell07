Begin the game.
Initialize a deck of cards containing 52 unique cards.
Shuffle the deck randomly.
Deal two cards to the player and two cards to the dealer from the top of the deck, alternating between player and dealer.
Display the player's two cards, showing one card and hiding the other.
Display the dealer's two cards, showing only one card and hiding the other.
Calculate the total value of the player's hand.
Allow the player to choose whether to "hit" (take another card) or "stay" (end their turn).
If the player chooses to hit, deal another card to the player and recalculate the total value of their hand.
If the total value of the player's hand exceeds 21, they bust and lose the game.
Repeat steps 8-10 until the player chooses to stay or busts.
If the player chooses to stay, reveal the dealer's hidden card and calculate the total value of the dealer's hand.
If the total value of the dealer's hand is less than 17, the dealer must hit until their hand total is 17 or higher.
If the total value of the dealer's hand exceeds 21, the dealer busts and the player wins.
Compare the total value of the player's hand to the total value of the dealer's hand:
If the player's hand total is higher than the dealer's hand total and does not exceed 21, the player wins.
If the dealer's hand total is higher than the player's hand total and does not exceed 21, the dealer wins.
If both the player and dealer have the same hand total, it's a tie.
Display the outcome of the game (player win, dealer win, or tie).
Ask the player if they want to play again.
If the player chooses to play again, repeat the game from step 3. Otherwise, end the game.
